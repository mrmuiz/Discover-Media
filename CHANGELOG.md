## Version 1.3.5.0

- Fix: **Android TV / Fire TV remote control** on the Discover page. Emby's own focus navigation did not know the Discover rows and popup: the focus jumped behind the popup and was pulled back to the close button, so **Request** could not be reached, and the first press down opened the side menu. The page now handles the remote itself through Emby's `command` events: left/right within a row, up/down between the search bar and the rows, the focus starts on the first title, and in the popup you move between Request, Trailer, Delete and the close button. Left on the first title of a row still opens Emby's side menu; Back closes the trailer or popup first, then leaves a genre/studio overview, then the page.
- Fix: Android TV is now recognised as a TV (Emby's `layout-tv` class, besides LG webOS and Samsung Tizen), so it gets the TV flow: tapping a title opens the popup with Request directly.
- Fix: the popup on TV no longer falls outside the screen. Sizes are based on the screen (`vh`/`vw`) instead of fixed pixels and Emby's enlarged TV text, with margins against TV overscan; long texts are shortened so the buttons always stay visible. The scroll arrows next to the rows are hidden on TV and the confirmation appears at the top.
- Trailers on Android TV still use the embedded YouTube player; on webOS/Tizen they keep using the Emby player.
- Technical: plugin version and request-button script version are both 1.3.5.0; script resource names changed (`discoveruijs1350`, `discoverbuttonjs1350`) to avoid cached scripts.

## Version 1.3.4.1

- Fix: the setting to turn the Trailer tile on or off was missing from the plugin settings. It is back as a checkbox ("Show the Trailer tile next to Request", on by default). With it off, the channel shows only the Request tile per title (series: only the season folder) and the Discover popup hides the Trailer button. The channel DataVersion changes with the setting, so Emby refreshes the title folders. `/Discover/Status` reports `ShowTrailerTile` again.
- Technical: plugin version and request-button script version are both 1.3.4.1.

## Version 1.3.4.0

- New: **More like this** on movie and series pages in the web client: TMDB recommendations (or similar titles) that are not in your library yet, each with a Request button. Clicking a poster opens the title in the Discover popup.
- New: **collection row** on movie pages: the other parts of the film series (TMDB collection) that you do not have yet, in the same layout.
- New: **Not in your library** on actor and director pages: their other movies and series from TMDB. Appearances as themselves, talk shows, news and reality series are skipped. Series open the season picker.
- Requesting from a row turns the button into the status (Requested / Available) and shows a confirmation.
- New routes: `/Discover/Related`, `/Discover/PersonCredits` and `/Discover/Seasons`.
- Titles that are already in Emby are filtered by TMDB id, with title + year as fallback. Series without a TMDB id in Emby are matched through their TVDB or IMDb id.
- Technical: script resource names changed (`discoveruijs1340`, `discoverbuttonjs1340`) to avoid cached browser scripts.

## Version 1.3.3.2

- Fix: LG webOS and Samsung Tizen TV apps. The Discover page detects TV clients and opens the title popup with the Request button directly instead of channel pages. Focus stays inside the popup and the Back key closes it.
- Fix: the Discover settings page could not load ("Load failed: configurationpage?name=discoverconfigjs...") because `configPage.html` pointed to a script name that `Plugin.cs` no longer registered. Both now use `discoverconfigjs1300`.
- Fix: the "Status" button on the settings page opened `discoverstatus1078`; the page is registered as `discoverstatus1079`.
- New: cancelling a request also removes its running downloads from the Radarr/Sonarr queue and the download client.
- New: routes `/Discover/TrailerKey` and `/Discover/Title`.
- Fix: the plugin version and the request-button script version are now both 1.3.3.2 (the script reported 1.1.3 while the Discover page expected 1.3.3.1).
- Technical: script resource names changed (`discoveruijs1336`, `discoverbuttonjs1331`, `discoverconfigjs1300`) to avoid cached browser scripts.

## Version 1.1.3

- Fix: the diagnostics on the Discover page still showed the request-button script as v1.1.0 while the plugin was newer. The plugin version and the script version are now the same everywhere (1.1.3), so the yellow diagnostics lines match.
- Compatibility: the plugin is now built against the Emby SDK package `MediaBrowser.Server.Core` 4.10.0.1-beta (was 4.11.0.5-beta6), so the same dll loads on Emby Server 4.10.2 and on the 4.11 beta. Before, Emby Server 4.10.2 could not load the plugin ("Could not load file or assembly MediaBrowser.Model, Version=4.11.0.5"). Installing was seen on both versions; not every function has been tested extensively on both.
- Technical: no functional changes, channel version and resource names stay the same.
