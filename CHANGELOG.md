## Version 1.1.3

- Fix: the diagnostics on the Discover page still showed the request-button script as v1.1.0 while the plugin was newer. The plugin version and the script version are now the same everywhere (1.1.3), so the yellow diagnostics lines match.
- Compatibility: the plugin is now built against the Emby SDK package `MediaBrowser.Server.Core` 4.10.0.1-beta (was 4.11.0.5-beta6), so the same dll loads on Emby Server 4.10.2 and on the 4.11 beta. Before, Emby Server 4.10.2 could not load the plugin ("Could not load file or assembly MediaBrowser.Model, Version=4.11.0.5"). Installing was seen on both versions; not every function has been tested extensively on both.
- Technical: no functional changes, channel version and resource names stay the same.
